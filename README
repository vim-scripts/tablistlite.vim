This plugin makes it very easy to switch tabs. This keeps track of the tabs you were working in recently, so that you may switch back to them very easily. All the tab switching can be done using keyboard only

So if  you used to working in a lot of tabs, then this plugin can make a lot of difference.

Command to open the recently worked tab list is

 :Tablisttoggle


Invoking this plugin opens a new horizontal window above the currently window.
This window will contain a list of tabs(that are still open and you have accessed previously).
The tabs are sorted on order in which you accessed. 
Top line shows the last tab you were on. The previous tab below it and so on.

To switch to a tab in the list, double click on the line or press enter when you are on the corresponding line. 

When a tab is closed, that tab is removed from the list. The tablist window closes automatically when it loses focus.
